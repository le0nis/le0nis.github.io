Vorboss is a B2B ISP focusing on the greater London area. We began selling to customers around the time I joined. During my first 3 months I assisted in scaling the commercial aspect of the business, creating reports on the existing market, collating and analysing information across the company for board meetings and aiding in the general strategic outlook of the company. I continue to excel in this capacity but have now also expanded to Revenue Operations Analyst where I scrape data from our CRM platforms and utilising Power BI and Excel scrutinise performance and existing strategy.
